But I decided it was not going to set me back, rather than use it as a learning step. So I was in the lookout for the next project to build my skills and show case something new, something different.When I came across Streamlit, I started looking into it as I was intrigued: \n"

    "Until then, I had never created an App, and from reading further about it, I soon found out I could build a Web App at no time. I thought \"Great!\" this would be the perfect project to take me to the next level! Then I thought... \"Hang on, and how do I deploy it?\" I have always liked to be prepared and plan things properly, so that got me thinking. At the time, there was no hosting capability, but that didn't stop me: with the mighty Google Search in hand, I found out I could use Docker to containerise my application, and Azure Cloud or GCP Cloud to deploy it! I was so excited: I had a good project idea and a full roadmap to implement it all the way. They say first you have to envision it and then make it happen and in that sense, it was my first step towards building my web App!\n",

    "Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build and deploy Web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science projects. And I can confirm, this is definitely the case. It also has a fantastic community that supports you all the way and it's a great place to exchange ideas and solve problems if you get stuck. \n",
